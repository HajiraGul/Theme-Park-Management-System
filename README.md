### OBJECTIVE:
**Objective:**
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive Theme Park Management System that efficiently manages various aspects of a theme park, including ride management, ticket sales, and visitor information, using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
+ DESCRIPTION:
  This project is a Theme Park Management System developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming course. The system enables users to manage rides, handle ticket bookings, and track visitor data effectively. It is 
  designed with a user-friendly interface and structured menus to enhance usability and streamline operations.
+ FEATURES:
  - **Ride Management:** Add, update, and remove rides with relevant details such as ride name, type, and capacity.
  - **Ticket Sales:** Manage ticket bookings, including different ticket types and prices.
  - **Visitor Information:** Store and retrieve visitor data for better customer relationship management.
  - **User Authentication:** Ensure secure access to the management system with user roles and permissions.
  - **Statistics and Reports:** Generate reports on ride usage, ticket sales, and visitor demographics.
+ KEY STEPS:
  - **Define Classes:** Identify the main entities (e.g., Ride, Ticket, Visitor) and create corresponding classes.
  - **Implement Inheritance:** Use inheritance to create specialized ride types that inherit common attributes from a base Ride class.
  - **Encapsulation:** Ensure that sensitive data is kept private and only accessible through public methods.
  - **Polymorphism:** Use method overriding to provide specific implementations for ride types.
  - **User Interface:** Develop a structured menu system for user interactions.
  - **Data Storage:** Implement methods for storing and retrieving data, potentially using file handling or in-memory structures.
+ TECHNOLOGIES USED:
  - **Programming Language:** C++
  - **OOP Concepts:** Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction
+ OUTCOME: The successful implementation of this Theme Park Management System demonstrates the practical application of OOP concepts, providing a scalable and maintainable solution for managing theme park operations.
+ FUTURE INTEGRATIONS:
  - **Online Ticket Booking:** Integrate an online payment system for ticket sales.
  - **Mobile Application:** Develop a mobile app for visitors to view ride information and purchase tickets.
  - **Analytics Dashboard:** Implement a dashboard for real-time analytics and reporting.
+ KEY STEPS TO RUN THE CODE:
  - Clone the repository to your local machine.
  - Open the project in your preferred IDE.
  - Compile the code to ensure there are no errors.
  - Run the main application file to start using the system.
  - Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the management features.
